# Pharet
PHARET (Phase Retarder) is a user-friendly version of a computer program for the Magnetic Materials Department at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). The original program was written in Fortran by Dr. Daniel Haskel and is currently used by departmental staff to determine the offset required from the Bragg angle to create circularly polarizing x-rays with diamond and silicone lenses. However, the original programâ€™ user interface is outdated and not user-friendly. 

The user-friendly version was written in Python and incorporates a GUI. The user-friendly version of the program is currently being installed at the beamline for users. Further revisions to the source code will be uploaded here when available.
